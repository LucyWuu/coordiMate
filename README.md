# CoordiMate
## Coordinate your schedule with your roommatesÔºÅ
Ever been in a rush to get ready for class, only to find your roommate taking an extra-long shower? Or tried to cook dinner with too many roommates in a small kitchen?

If you've experienced these challenges of living off-campus, you're not alone. 

That's why I made CoordiMate for me and my roommates!
